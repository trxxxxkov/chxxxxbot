"""Handlers for bot commands that are hidden from user interface.

To show a command to a user, the command must be added to the list of commands. 
Otherwise the command will work, but the user will not get any syntax tips while
typing it.
 The following commands are intended to onetime usage or are so rare that they
were hidden to save free space in Bot Menu in Telegram interface.
