# Claude Integration: Phase 1.4 (Advanced API Features)

Review Claude API documentation, extract best practices and advanced features, implement improvements to Phase 1.3.

**Status:** 📋 **IN PROGRESS** (Documentation review)

---

## Overview

Phase 1.4 focuses on studying official Claude API documentation and implementing advanced features and best practices discovered during the review.

### Process

1. **User provides documentation link** (e.g., https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/...)
2. **Read and analyze the page** together
3. **Discuss what to adopt** for our project
4. **Document decision** in this file with link to page
5. **Note implementation details** - what specifically to implement
6. **Later: implement** - during implementation, revisit each page and write code

### Documentation Structure

For each reviewed page, we'll add:
- Link to documentation page
- Date reviewed
- Key insights from the page
- What we decided to adopt (specific techniques, patterns)
- Implementation notes (which files to change, what to add)
- What we decided to skip (and why)

## Documentation Pages Reviewed

*This section will be filled as we review pages.*

<!-- Template for each page:

### [Page Title]

**Link:** https://docs.anthropic.com/...
**Date reviewed:** YYYY-MM-DD

**Key insights:**
- Important insight 1
- Important insight 2

**What we'll implement:**
- Technique/feature 1
  - Implementation: `file_path:line` or description
  - Why: rationale
- Technique/feature 2
  - Implementation: description
  - Why: rationale

**What we'll skip:**
- Feature X: reason why not needed for our use case

## Implementation Plan

*This section will be filled after we finish reviewing all documentation.*

Once we've reviewed all relevant pages, we'll create an implementation checklist:
- [ ] Task 1 from Page X
- [ ] Task 2 from Page Y
- etc.

## Summary

Phase 1.4 is documentation-driven optimization. We read official docs, discuss each page, and document decisions. Implementation happens after review is complete.

**Current status:** Ready to start reviewing documentation.

**Next step:** Provide first documentation link to review.
